    title: 'The Art of Afrofuturist Storytelling in Animation',
    excerpt: 'How animation is reshaping narratives about African futures and identities.',
    content: `# The Art of Afrofuturist Storytelling in Animation

Afrofuturism in animation is creating new narratives that celebrate African heritage while imagining bold futures. Here's how creators are revolutionizing the medium:

## What is Afrofuturism?

Afrofuturism blends African culture, technology, science fiction, and fantasy to envision futures centered on Black experiences and perspectives.

## Notable Works

### Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire
Netflix's groundbreaking anthology series featuring 10 African animation studios.

### Iw√°j√∫
Disney's collaboration with Pan-African studio Kugali set in future Lagos.

### Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
Features Miles Morales in stunning Afrofuturist aesthetics.

## Why It Matters

Animation allows us to:
- Visualize African futures without Western colonial frameworks
- Celebrate traditional art forms in modern contexts
- Create representation for young audiences
- Challenge stereotypes and expand imagination

## Join Our Animation Workshops

At Bantu Ants, we host regular animation workshops where you can learn from African animators and create your own Afrofuturist stories!`,
